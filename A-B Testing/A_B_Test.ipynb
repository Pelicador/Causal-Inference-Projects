    "Omnibay, a fast-growing e-commerce platform selling everything from books to electronics, began noticing unusual trends - electronics were driving high traffic but also the most cart abandonments and support issues. Customers were engaging heavily with electronics but often leaving without completing purchases, prompting internal discussions about whether a dedicated electronics website might better serve that audience. Recognizing the need for data-driven decision-making, the leadership team decided to bring in a data analyst to investigate customer behavior, shopping patterns, and potential impacts on the overall business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Omnibay wants to run an experiment to see if we can convince more people to purchase our electronics if we use a dedicated technology website. We’ve designed a new modern website, but aren’t sure if this strategy will sell enough units to benefit from establishing a business relationship with a new provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this experiment, of course, we need to know the sample size that will be required to detect the difference we are hoping for. There are three things we need to know before we can determine that number.\n",
