# Causal-Inference-Projects

## A/B Testing
A comprehensive A/B testing project for a website that demonstrates advanced data science capabilities including experimental design with proper power analysis and sample size calculation (determining 10,572 total users needed), statistical hypothesis testing using both linear regression and two-sample t-tests to validate results, and business impact quantification that translated a 10.8% relative conversion rate improvement into $119,465 additional monthly revenue. The analysis employed Python with pandas, numpy, statsmodels, and scipy for data manipulation and statistical computing, utilized historical baseline analysis from customer data, conducted rigorous significance testing (p < 0.001), and integrated findings with business requirements to provide actionable recommendations including ROI calculations (19.5% monthly return) and phased implementation strategies. The project showcased end-to-end data science workflow from data simulation and experimental design through statistical validation and executive-level reporting, demonstrating proficiency in both technical statistical methods and business-oriented data storytelling for strategic decision-making.
